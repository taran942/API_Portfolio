                            An API is simply a medium to fetch or send data between interfaces. 
                            Let’s say you want to make an application that provides the user with some real-time data fetched from the server or maybe even allows you to modify or add data to some other endpoint.
                            This is made possible by the API or the Application Programming Interface.
                            We will use a simple public API that requires no authentication and allows you to fetch some data by querying the API with GET requests.
                            https://randomuser.me/ is a website that provides dummy data for random users that we can easily work with. We can get the response by making a request to https://randomuser.me/api/. The JSON response that we receive is in the following format.

                        <p> If we talk about the architectures, API’s architectures are:
                            <br>
                            REST (Representational State Transfer) 
                            SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) 
                            Both define a standard communication protocol for the exchange of messages in XML (Extensible Markup Language). 
                            <br><br>
                            How is an API Different From a Web Application?
                            An API acts as an interface that allows proper communication between two programs whereas a web application is a network-based resource responsible for completing a single task. Also, it’s important to know that “All web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web”.
                            <br><br>
                            The difference between an API and a web application is that API allows two-way communication and web applications are just a way for users to interact through a web browser. A web application may have an API to complete the requests.

                        1. WEB APIs
                        A Web API also called Web Services is an extensively used API over the web and can be easily accessed using the HTTP protocols. A Web API is an open-source interface and can be used by a large number of clients through their phones, tablets, or PCs. 
                        <br><br>
                        2. LOCAL APIs
                        In this type of API, the programmers get the local middleware services. TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface), and .NET are common examples of Local APIs.
                        <br><br>
                        3. PROGRAM APIs
                        It makes a remote program appear to be local by making use of RPCs (Remote Procedural Calls). SOAP is a well-known example of this type of API.</p>
